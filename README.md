# Healthcare-Data-Exploration
Visualize patient data like blood pressure, sugar levels,  and weight to identify health trends.
Healthcare data analysis is an essential aspect of modern medical practices and research. By analyzing patient data, such as blood pressure, sugar levels, and weight, healthcare professionals can identify trends that can lead to early diagnosis, better treatment plans, and improved patient outcomes. In this project, we explore patient data to identify trends and relationships between health metrics using data
visualization and basic machine learning models.
